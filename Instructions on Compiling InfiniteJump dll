##Making the InfiniteJump.dll for Silksong:

STEP 1: Create a folder in your Documents directory (or where ever you want) named "ref"

STEP 2: Copy the following files into the ref folder:

--These files will be located in your Silksong_Data/core and /Managed Directories. You will need 5 dll files total:

 - In Silksong/core (BepInEx.dll)
 - In Silksong/Managed (UnityEngine.dll ; UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll ; UnityEngine.Physics2DModule.dll ; UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll)
 
 --- DO NOT CUT AND PASTE -- Simply COPY the files and paste them in the ref folder. ---
 
STEP 3: Create the .cs and CSPROJ files. Either download them from my GitHub or you can do it yourself by opening a terminal and using GEDIT. Once GEDIT is open copy the code from my InfiniteJumpCS text paste it and save it to your "ref" folder as InfiniteJump.cs. The CSPROJ is just a text file, so either just use mine from the GitHub or if you want to make your own, open a text editor like Notes and copy the code from my file and paste it in. Then save it to your "ref" folder as InfiniteJunmpCSPROJ.
 
 I offer two options because of some you may want to tweak the code I am using to your own likings.
 
STEP 4: Verify everything you need is in the "ref" folder:
 
 - InfiniteJump.cs
 - InfiniteJumpCSPROJ
 - BepInEx.dll
 - UnityEngine.dll
 - UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
 - UnityEngine.Physics2DModule.dll
 - UnityEngine.InputLegacyModule.dll
 
 ***Once verified move on to step 5****
 
STEP 5: If you don't already have it, install .Net SDK
 
 In your terminal copy and paste these commands: 
 
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0

#Check your dotnet versios using the command: dotnet --version
It should 8.0.x

STEP 6 Compile your mod:

In your terminal cd to your ref folder and in the terminal type the command: dotnet build -c Release

Once it's finished compiling, your InfiniteJump.dll should be in /refs/bin/Release/net472/ folder.

Copy and paste your dll into Silksong/BepInEx/plugins/ folder and start the game. 

***You MAY have to start the game and then exit out and start again to allow the mod to hook to Hornet's body (so to speak).

****PLEASE NOTE**** While this is a harmless mod, I can't do "tech support" if it doesn't work. So, please uderstand, this worked for me and I am simply sharing with you all in the spirit of Linux.
